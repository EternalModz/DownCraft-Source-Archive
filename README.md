# DownCraft Source Archive
Now that the DownCraft project is fully open, I have decided to fully open-source all of the DownCraft source code that I have.

## Status
The DownCraft project will now be continued by me. I have Misaki's full permission to take over the project, and I will update this repository every time I make changes to DownCraft. DownCraft projects will now be fully open to the community, and all of its source code will be posted here.

## My goals with the new projects
My goal for the new DownCraft projects is to thoroughly clean up all of the code and rewrite it to best suit its new open-source nature. I intend to give proper credit to everyone for their contributions. Many developers who supported the older projects have not received proper credit, and I intend to restore their credits and give them the recognition they deserve.

## What happened?
Misaki has made the decision to complete the DownCraft project. It is now fully finished, and he has chosen to release all of his source code. I am pleased to announce that I have acquired the rights to this code by compensating Misaki. Consequently, I am now able to release my own source code for DownCraft as well. The main folders contain code from several of my projects for DownCraft, as well as the standard ones from Misaki.

I have acquired a significant amount of this source code, and I am delighted to share it with everyone. All I request for my contributions to this project is proper credit. In many projects that include my code, I have not been acknowledged, and I simply desire recognition for the work I have done. I have meticulously reviewed each folder and eliminated any malware or loggers from Misaki's tools, ensuring that everything is safe to use.

In private discussions with Misaki, we have mutually agreed that it is best for me to assume control of the project from now on. I have obtained his full permission to proceed as I see fit, and I am eagerly looking forward to updating and making everything available for everyone to utilize. I extend my gratitude to all those who have contributed to the growth of the legacy console modding community. Without the collective effort of everyone involved, this achievement would not have been possible.

## Why am I re-releasing code that Misaki already released?
I am releasing this code once again because many people don't have some of the code that I have. I helped Misaki many times in his RTM projects, and he never gave me credit for the times I helped him. I would like to give the community my work and show them how I assisted Misaki in designing and cleaning up his tools. I want everyone to have access to the source code of these projects, and I think it's very unfair that I worked so hard to help him, yet he didn't even include my name in the credits of any of his projects.
